<h1 class="topictitle1">Constraints on the use of the 
<span>Service Facade to WebSphere MQ: request-response</span> pattern</h1>
<div>
<p class="shortdesc">A number of constraints apply when you use this pattern.</p>
	<p>
	You can use the
	<span>Service Facade to WebSphere MQ: request-response</span> pattern only if you 
	meet all of the following constraints:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Requests must be received as SOAP messages over HTTP.
		</li>
		<li>
			Requesting applications must support a synchronous request response interaction 
			style.
		</li>
		<li>
			Provider applications must be able to respond to requests in a time frame 
			appropriate for synchronous interaction.
		</li>
		<li>
			Provider applications can receive requests and return responses over WebSphere MQ.
		</li>
		<li>
			Provider applications must support the standard behavior of copying the message 
			identifier to the correlation identifier.
		</li>
		<li>
			WSDLs defining the broker interface have only one port type and one binding.
		</li>
		<li>
			WSDLs must contain the definitions that define properties for the SOAPInput node in the
			definitions of the top level WSDL. Therefore, some complex nested WSDLs cannot automatically
			be processed by the pattern.
			<p>If WSDLs that do not meet this constraint are used, the pattern does not configure the 
			SOAPInput node, but lists configuration of the SOAPInput node 
			as a task to complete after generation of the pattern instance.</p> 
			
		</li>
		<li>
			The provider application supports WebSphere MQ XML messages in a format that can be used 
			as the body of a SOAP request and response, or you can customize the Request 
			Processing subflow to transform the format to non-XML messages.
		</li>
		<li>
			If logging is required, the format used by this pattern is assumed to meet your
			requirements.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can deploy and run the application that is generated from the pattern instance to an integration node that has a queue manager.
			To check whether your integration node has a queue manager, in the Integration Nodes view, select the integration node in the Properties 
			view and check that the <b>Queue manager specified on the integration node</b> field is not blank. If the Properties view is not visible, 
			click <b>Window > Show Properties</b>. To specify a queue manager for an integration node, in the Integration Nodes view, right-click the 
			target integration node and click <b>Change</b>, then enter the required queue manager name.
		</li>
	</ul>
