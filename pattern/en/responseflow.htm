<div><h1 class="topictitle1">Response flow for the <span>Service Facade to WebSphere MQ: request-response</span> pattern</h1>
<p class="shortdesc">The Response flow runs as a non-transactional flow.</p>
<p>When a response is received
from the provider application, the following actions are taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Response flow reads the response message from the provider. 
Validation is determined by the pattern parameters.</li>
<li>The flow uses the correlation ID to retrieve the SOAP Reply Identifier 
from the internal WebSphere MQ queue. 
The SOAP Reply Identifier is added to the local environment to 
control the destination for the SOAP reply.</li>
<li>An HTTP reply header is created.</li>
<li>If an exception occurs and error logging is 
included in the pattern application, the Error subflow is called, 
and an error is written to the response queue. 
However, because failure implies that the ReplyID that had to reply to the SOAP request 
is not available, no attempt is made to reply to the requester.</li>
<li>A successful response is logged only if logging is included in this pattern application 
and is currently turned on.
</li>
