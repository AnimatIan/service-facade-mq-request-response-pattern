<span>Service Facade to WebSphere MQ: request-response</span> pattern</h1>
<p class="shortdesc">
Tasks that you must complete after you have generated the pattern.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Create the broker archive (BAR) file. The message flow must be added to a broker 
		archive file. Any message sets that are referenced by the flow are automatically 
		added.
		<ol>
			
			<li>
				Click <span class="uicontrol">File &gt; New &gt; BAR File</span>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Enter the name of your server project or select one from the displayed list. The 
				list is filtered to show only projects in the active working set.
			</li>
			<li>
				Enter a name for the BAR file that you are creating.
			</li>
			<li>
				Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.
				
				A file with a <span class="filepath">.bar</span> extension is created and is displayed in the Broker 
				Administration Navigator view, under the Broker Archives folder. The Content 
				editor for the BAR file opens.
				
			</li>
            <li>
               	On the Prepare tab, select the generated message flow file to add it to your BAR file.  
            </li>
            <li>
            	Select <span class="uicontrol">Compile and in-line resources</span> and then click <span class="uicontrol">Build and Save</span> to create your BAR file.
            </li>			
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		Configure the broker archive file. Further configuration of the message flow in the broker archive  
		file is not required before you deploy the message flows for your
		<span>Service Facade to WebSphere MQ: request-response</span>
		pattern instance, but you might want to review some of the default options and 
		configure changes for your environment.
		
		In the Manage page of the Broker Archive editor:
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				<span>
				Optional: Use the <span class="msobjprop">RequestLoggingOn</span>
				user-defined property to select whether logging is on or off for the Request 
				message flow.
				</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span>
				Optional: Use the <span class="msobjprop">ResponseLoggingOn</span>
				user-defined property to select whether logging is on or off for the Response 
				message flow.
				</span>
			</li>
			<li>Optional: Use the <span class="msobjprop">ErrorLoggingOn</span>
				user-defined property to select whether error messages are generated.
			</li>
			<li>Optional: You can change any of the configurable properties in the broker 
				archive, for example, properties for security or creating additional instances.
				
				<p>You must ensure that any values that you change do not impact the behavior of the 
				pattern instance.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		Create queues. When you apply the pattern, a list of WebSphere MQ queues is 
		generated with queue names and queue manager names, these WebSphere MQ queues must be created if 
		they do not already exist. All of the message settings that are required by the 
		pattern are set explicitly on the messages and are not dependent on queue 
		settings.
		<ol>
			<li>In the summary file, view the list of queues that you must create. The summary file 
 		is located in the Pattern Configuration folder of the 
 		<i>InstanceName</i> pattern instance project.</li>
			<li>Create <span>WebSphere MQ</span> resources. You can create <span>WebSphere MQ</span>
				resources either on the command line by using programs and 
				utilities such as <span class="cmdname">runmqsc</span>, or by using the
				<span>WebSphere MQ</span> Explorer graphical interface. For more information about creating
				<span>WebSphere MQ</span> resources, see 
				<cite><span>WebSphere MQ</span> Intercommunication</cite>, available on the 
				 <img src="images/external_link.gif" alt="This link opens in a new window" class="external_link" />
				<a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/library/" target="_blank">WebSphere 
				MQ library</a> web page.
				
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Deploy the BAR file. The message set containing the deployable WSDL must 
		be deployed, by using the same or another BAR file, to every broker where the flows 
			are deployed.
	</li>
