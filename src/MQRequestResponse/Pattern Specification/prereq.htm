<h1 class="topictitle1">Tasks to complete before applying the 
<span>Service Facade to WebSphere MQ: request-response</span> pattern</h1>
<div class="p">
	<p class="shortdesc">Before applying the pattern to produce a pattern instance, you must determine
which of the following tasks are required. If required, complete the following tasks:</p>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>
		Identify that this pattern meets your business requirement and can be supported 
		by both the requester and provider applications.
	</li>
	<li>
		Define, or identify the provider interface and associated service interface.
	</li>
	<li>
		Name the pattern instance. Identify the purpose of the pattern application so that you can 
		decide on an appropriate name.
	</li>
	<li>
		Select WebSphere MQ queues and queue managers. Existing queue managers and queues can be 
		used, for example, to access the provider application, and you must choose their names.
	</li>
	<li>
		Identify any additional queue managers and queues that are required for this pattern and 
		decide upon their names. Take into account any policies, standards, or 
		naming conventions that must apply.
	</li>
	<li>
		Decide whether you require logging. If logging is required, you must decide to which queue 
		manager and queue the logging messages are sent. You can send logging messages 
		to a general log queue that is used by multiple message flows, or you can use 
		a queue specifically for the pattern instance.
	</li>
	<li>
		Decide whether you require error messages.
	</li>
	<li>
		Decide whether you require validation.
	</li>
	<li>
		Create deployable WSDL in a message set project.
	</li>
</ul>
