	Details about the Request flow, including logging and exceptions, for the 
	<span>Service Facade to WebSphere MQ: request-response</span> pattern.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			A SOAP request is received on a SOAP node. The request is validated if validation is required, 
			by the pattern parameters for each pattern instance.
		</li>
		<li>
			The SOAP and HTTP headers are removed to leave the basic XML message targeted at 
			the provider application.
		</li>
		<li>
			The message then passes to a request processing subflow, which provides a place 
			for customization of a pattern instance.
		</li>
		<li>
			An MQMD header is inserted with the Reply address of the Integration Bus and the 
			expiry time is set in accordance with the expected response time.
		</li>
		<li>
			The message is placed on the provider queue.
		</li>
		<li>
			A message to store the SOAP reply identifier is set up. 
			The message identifier that is generated 
			for the outgoing message is retrieved from the written destination data in the 
			local environment, and is used in the MQMD correlation identifier; the SOAP reply 
			identifier is retrieved from the local environment and is used as the body of the 
			message. This data is written to an internal queue.
		</li>
		<li>
			If exceptions occur before the message is sent to the provider, a SOAP fault is 
			returned to the provider. If error messages are required, an error message 
			is sent to the error queue.
		</li>
		<li>
			If logging of requests is required and the message flow succeeds, the 
			logging subflow is called to log the incoming message.
		</li>
